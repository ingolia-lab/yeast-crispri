<h1 class="page-title">Yeast CRISPRi</h1>

This site is a resource for our system for yeast CRISPRi screening,
described in [McGlincy et al., 2019](ZZZ). This system comprises:

* A guide RNA library with ten guides per gene for most genes

* Inducible CRISPRi implemented by

  - Expression of the dCas9-Mxi effector, and the tetR regulatory
    protein, from an integrated construct

  - A library of episomal guide RNA expression plasmids

* Random nucleotide barcodes linked with each guide RNA

  - Multiple barcodes per guide provide independent measurements of
    guide effects

  - Linear barcode amplification by in vitro transcription, reducing
    noise relative to exponential PCR
