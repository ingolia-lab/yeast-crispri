title: Barcodes v1 181005
---

The guide library v1 oligos were cloned into an sgRNA expression
vector and barcodes were subsequently added by cloning random
oligonucleotides. _Note_ that the barcode assignments here are
specific to this plasmid library and quite arbitrary, as they result
from random events that occurred during this cloning reaction. They
don't reflect a designed property of the guide oligos.

The [`barcode_v1_181005/grna-assign-barcode-grna-good.txt`]() table
associates barcodes with guide RNAs. Certain barcodes are associated
with `Empty` guide RNA expression constructs that are not expected to
produce functional sgRNAs. These arise at low frequency due to the
guide cloning reaction and we typically treat them as internal
negative controls.
